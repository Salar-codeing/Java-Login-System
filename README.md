# Java-Login-System
This is a simple java login system
The username is admin and the password is 1234.

incase you want to change the password or the username
you should got to line 107 and there you will see this:



            here you set the username
                      /|\
                      |||
                     /---\
if (username.equals("admin") && password.equals("1234")) {
                                                \----/
                                                  ||
                                                  \/
                                        here you set the pasword

that is all you need to know.
I did not use any plugins or anything
